Everything that we don't need black while the objects that we want to detect white.
So, we want the vehicles and motorbikes white and other back.

But there are many whites.

Get the coordinates of all the white elements and then remove all the really small elements that we don't need.

For example, the trees, small dots.

Steps:
* 1. How to detect objects in a certain space?
* 2. Which method to choose to detect the objects?
* 3. A best more sophisticated and reliable object tracking method?
